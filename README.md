# MQTTClient

MQTTClient is a component that implements a MQTT client using ESP-IDF SDK API and also compatible with ```arm mbed```.

It can be accessed through different topic updates, using binary data structures (blob). These struct definitions are included in file ```MQTTClientBlob.h```, so other componentes can include this file, to communicate with it.
